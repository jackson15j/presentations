Presentations (Lightning Talks)
===============================

Planning to keep any presentations that I give here for prosperity.

Render Presentation:
====================

I'm using [landslide] to render the presentation with the following command:

```bash
landslide <presentation.md> --relative --copy-theme
```

This can then be hosted locally with:

```python
# Python 3:
python -m 'http.server'
# Python 2:
python -m 'SimpleHTTPServer'
```
